- **Towards Life** 
> I love to travel, love to experience new things. I have a pleasant personality and make friends easily.

## My Official Account (IN CHINESE)
I am operating a WeChat official account. Dedicated to knowledge sharing of AI-related skills. In early 2020, we were greatly affected by the pandemic. Many schools were unable to open and started online classes. Some schools started using DingTalk for online teaching. However, it was a big challenge for local teachers to use DingTalk to teach online because many of them were not familiar with this software, at that time, there were no in-depth official tutorials. Therefore, I came up with the idea to make tutorials videos on how to use DingTalk for online teaching and online examinations. After two sessions, I got a lot of positive feedback from teachers. Finally, I made ten tutorial videos on how to use DingTalk. After this series was finished, I started making some tutorials on Python programming and writing articles on English listening and English reading.

This official account has become part of my life. On the one hand, this public number can more or less bring some help to others , on the other hand, it also constantly inspires me not to stop learning. Now, my official account mainly contains the following important iisections:

- **Python Tuitions**

I post orginal tutorial videos about Python programming. Aiming at guiding beginners to learn Python programming from scrach. In this series, I posted/ will post tuitions about:

> Branching and iteration

> String manipulation

> Guess and check method, approximations method and bisection method

> Functions

> Tuples and lists

> Recursion and dictionaries

> Testing, debugging, exceptions, and assertions

> Object oriented programming 

> Python classes and inheritance

> Program efficiency

> Searching and sorting

- **Data Structure and Algorithms**

In this series, I posted/will post something about data structures and algorithms. I will collect some interesting algorithm problems, and then analyze the solutions and code implementation of each algorithm problem. I will make this process as a video tutorial. Of course, some of the algorithm solutions may be inspired by the solution from web, but I will express them in my own words based on my own understanding. In this series, I posted/will post videos about:

> Algorithms about arrays

> Algorithms about bisection trees

> Algorithms about binary trees 

> Dynamic programming

> Famous algorithms

> Algoriths about graph

> Algoriths about heaps

> Algorithms about linked lists

> Algorithms about recursion

> Algorithms about searching and sorting

> Algorithms about stacks

> Algorithms about strings

> ...

- **Special Planning**

When I come up with content that is interesting or helpful to a lot of people, or a fan suggests something interesting, I'll make a video or article to put in this special planning series.
